# ADR-001: Todo Application Architecture and Technology Stack

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Approved by Principal Engineer (2025-01-02)

## Context

We need to implement a modern, production-ready Todo application that demonstrates best practices in full-stack development. The application must serve as both a functional product and a showcase of proper software engineering practices including research-driven development, comprehensive testing, security best practices, and maintainable architecture.

### Requirements Analysis

**Functional Requirements:**
- Complete CRUD operations for todos
- Real-time user interface with responsive design  
- Todo filtering and bulk operations
- Data persistence and state management
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Production-ready architecture and security
- Comprehensive test coverage (90%+ backend, 85%+ frontend)
- Performance optimization (< 1.5s First Contentful Paint)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
- Modern developer experience with TypeScript and tooling

## Research Summary

Extensive research was conducted across multiple domains to inform architectural decisions:

### Frontend Framework Analysis
- **React ecosystem patterns 2024**: Component-driven architecture, hooks-based patterns, functional programming paradigms
- **TodoMVC implementations**: Analyzed patterns from official TodoMVC examples and community implementations
- **State management solutions**: Comparative analysis of Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and React Query approaches

### Backend Architecture Research  
- **Express.js best practices**: Three-layer architecture patterns, TypeScript integration, security middleware
- **Node.js production patterns**: Error handling, logging, performance optimization, deployment strategies
- **API design principles**: RESTful patterns, validation strategies, response optimization

### Testing Strategy Research
- **Modern testing stack**: Migration from Jest to Vitest, React Testing Library best practices
- **API mocking strategies**: Mock Service Worker (MSW) for realistic testing scenarios
- **Test-driven development**: TDD patterns for both frontend and backend development

## Decision

### Architecture Pattern: Three-Layer Backend Architecture

**Decision**: Implement backend using three-layer architecture (Controllers → Services → Models)

**Rationale**: 
- Separates concerns clearly: HTTP handling, business logic, and data access
- Enables easier testing by isolating business logic from infrastructure  
- Scales well as application complexity grows
- Follows industry best practices for Express.js applications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Monolithic single-layer**: Rejected due to poor separation of concerns
- **Clean Architecture**: Considered but deemed over-engineered for current scope
- **Microservices**: Rejected as premature optimization for single-feature application

### Frontend Architecture: Component-Driven with Modern React Patterns

**Decision**: React 18 with functional components, custom hooks, and component composition

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard approach in 2024
- Excellent developer experience with hooks and modern patterns
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Aligns with existing codebase standards

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Class components**: Rejected as legacy pattern
- **Vue.js or Angular**: Rejected to maintain consistency with React ecosystem
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Rejected due to complexity and development velocity concerns

### State Management: Hybrid Approach

**Decision**: React Query for server state + React hooks for local state + Zustand for complex client state (if needed)

**Rationale**:
- **React Query**: Proven solution for server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **React Hooks**: Sufficient for simple local state (form inputs, UI state)  
- **Zustand**: Available for complex client state if requirements evolve
- Avoids over-engineering while providing growth path

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Redux Toolkit**: Rejected as overly complex for current requirements
- **Context API only**: Rejected due to performance concerns and lack of server state management
- **Zustand only**: Rejected as React Query provides superior server state management

### Build System: Vite

**Decision**: Vite for both development and production builds

**Rationale**:
- Superior performance compared to Create React App
- Modern ES modules support
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Active development and growing ecosystem
- Create React App deprecated in 2023

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Create React App**: Rejected due to deprecation and performance issues
- **Webpack**: Rejected due to configuration complexity
- **Parcel**: Considered but Vite has better ecosystem integration

### Testing Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW

**Decision**: Modern testing stack replacing Jest-based solutions

**Rationale**:
- **Vitest**: Native Vite integration, faster execution than Jest, modern API
- **React Testing Library**: Industry standard for React component testing
- **MSW**: Service Worker-based mocking more realistic than traditional HTTP mocking
- Unified stack providing excellent developer experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Jest**: Rejected due to slower performance and configuration complexity with Vite
- **Cypress**: Considered for E2E but deemed beyond current scope
- **Playwright**: Considered but E2E testing not in initial requirements

### Database Strategy: In-Memory with Database Abstraction

**Decision**: Start with in-memory storage with repository pattern for future database integration

**Rationale**:
- Meets current requirements without over-engineering
- Repository pattern provides clean abstraction for future database integration
- Enables comprehensive testing without external dependencies
- Clear migration path to persistent storage

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **SQLite**: Considered but adds complexity for demo application
- **PostgreSQL**: Rejected as over-engineering for current scope
- **MongoDB**: Rejected due to complexity and infrastructure requirements

### TypeScript Configuration: Strict Mode

**Decision**: Enable TypeScript strict mode for both frontend and backend

**Rationale**:
- Catches more bugs at compile time
- Improves code documentation and maintainability
- Industry best practice for new projects
- Better IDE support and developer experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Gradual TypeScript adoption**: Rejected as starting new project
- **JavaScript only**: Rejected due to lack of type safety benefits

### Security Approach: Defense in Depth

**Decision**: Multi-layered security approach using Helmet, CORS, input validation, and XSS prevention

**Rationale**:
- Security is critical for production-ready applications
- Multiple layers provide redundancy if one measure fails
- Industry standard middleware (Helmet) provides comprehensive protection
- Input validation prevents data corruption and injection attacks

**Security Measures**:
- **Backend**: Helmet security headers, CORS configuration, Express Validator, rate limiting
- **Frontend**: XSS prevention, Content Security Policy, secure communication
- **Infrastructure**: HTTPS enforcement, environment variable protection

### Performance Strategy: Progressive Optimization

**Decision**: Implement core functionality first, then optimize based on real performance data

**Performance Targets**:
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Bundle size: < 300KB initial load
- API response times: < 200ms for CRUD operations
- Test execution time: < 10s for complete suite

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Code splitting with React.lazy
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Efficient re-rendering (React.memo, useMemo)
- HTTP caching headers
- Response compression

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Workflow: Test-Driven Development

**Decision**: Follow TDD principles throughout development

**Rationale**:
- Ensures code quality and test coverage
- Provides documentation through tests
- Catches regressions early
- Aligns with quality-focused development goals

### Deployment Strategy: Docker with Multi-Stage Builds

**Decision**: Docker containers with separate development and production configurations

**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Optimized production builds
- Easy local development setup
- Platform-independent deployment

2. **Over-Engineering Risk**: Modern stack may be complex for simple todo application  
   - *Mitigation*: Implement MVP first, add complexity incrementally based on needs

3. **Dependency Risk**: Multiple modern dependencies may introduce breaking changes
   - *Mitigation*: Pin dependency versions, regular security audits, update strategy

4. **Performance Risk**: Modern tooling may introduce overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Performance budgets, regular performance audits, optimization guidelines

### Migration Path

If decisions need to be revisited:

1. **State Management**: Easy to migrate from hooks to Zustand or Redux Toolkit if complexity increases
2. **Database**: Repository pattern enables smooth migration to persistent storage
3. **Testing**: MSW and RTL provide good foundation that's compatible with additional testing tools
4. **Build System**: Vite configuration can be extended or migrated to other tools if needed
